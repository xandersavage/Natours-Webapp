# Natours-Webapp
An extensive node js web app 
This web app is not fully complete yet. All features have not been included.
Natours is a fictional company where users can book tours for different locations.
It is not responsive yet so please view using a laptop.
It uses mongoDB to store user data and also tour data.
Users can login to their dashboard, make payments for tours(not yet implemented), view tour locations(using mapbox) and much more
Some features have been implemented in the back end but not yet reflected in the front end(I use postman).
Code is super clean and each functionality is broken down into different modules.
